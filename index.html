      <h1>You are Apple</h1>
      <p>For too long, Apple's corporate work conditions have been hidden in an opaque, intimidating fortress. We're collecting & sharing stories from Apple workers to help the world see instances and patterns of racism, sexism, inequity, discrimination, intimidation, abuse, unfair punishment, and unchecked privilege.</p>
      <p>We must work together, as colleagues - Corporate, AppleCare, and Retail - to demand systemic change in our work place.</p>

            Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act ("NLRA") in 1935 to protect the rights of employees and employers, to encourage collective bargaining, and to curtail certain private sector labor and management practices, which can harm the general welfare of workers, businesses and the U.S. economy.

          <blockquote>
            You have the right to act with coworkers to address work-related issues in many ways. Examples include: talking with one or more co-workers about your wages and benefits or other working conditions, circulating a petition asking for better hours, participating in a concerted refusal to work in unsafe conditions, and joining with coworkers to talk directly to your employer, to a government agency, or to the media about problems in your workplace. Your employer cannot discharge, discipline, or threaten you for, or coercively question you about, this "protected concerted" activity. However, you can lose protection by saying things about your employer that are egregiously offensive or knowingly and maliciously false, or by publicly disparaging your employer's products or services without relating your complaints to any labor controversy.

      <h1>We, the workers, are Apple</h1>
      <p>
        Apple's culture of secrecy is an opaque, intimidating fortress. We have felt isolated, devalued, and gaslit each time we try to seek recourse and accountability for injustices we witness or experience in our workplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No more.</strong> We're collecting & sharing stories from Apple workers to help the world see instances and patterns of racism, sexism, inequity, discrimination, intimidation, suppression, coercion, abuse, unfair punishment, and unchecked privilege.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are coming together to understand and dissiminate our rights as workers, and how to seek protection and retribution when our rights are being violated.
      </p>
      <p>
        We <strong>must</strong> work together, as colleagues - Corporate, AppleCare, and Retail - to demand systemic change in our work place.

      <h1>Change is non-negotiable</h1>
      <p>We must have a clear outline of how we can demand systemic change within Apple. This starts with upholding a psychologically safe working environment. We want to feel like our privacy is just as imperitive to Apple as our customers' is to all of us. We want to feel confident that we are being compensated fairly, commensurate to our experience and with our peers. We want to feel safe to exercise our rights as workers, and to seek remedy in our internal processes if it's needed.</p>

        <li><strong>No more personal iCloud syncing</strong>. An iCloud account using Corporate email accounts should be provided to keep workers’ personal data private.</li>
        <li><strong>No more requiring personal numbers in Apple Directory</strong>. Workers who require devices should have a dedicated number and be allowed a personal device unlinked from Apple’s corporate ecosystem.</li>
        <li><strong>Publish pay bands</strong>. Give candidates and current workers a transparent look at salary ranges per role, per org, to help empower them to negotiate fair wages.</li>
        <li><strong>Audit Sedgwick and reconsider our relationship with them</strong>. Workers report feeling their medical privacy is being invaded and that they are forced to prove they have disabilities, which is not in line with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or section 509 of the Rehabilitation Act. Medical data should be kept properly scoped and private per issue, and workers should have clear transparency about who has access to data, how it is stored, and how to request removal of any and all medical records.</li>
        <li><strong>Hold People, Employee Relations, Business Conduct, and Leadership accountable</strong>. These teams and leaders should not only be focused on protecting Apple’s image and avoiding litigation. Workers should feel psychologically safe to report issues, request accommodation, and get information in a way that upholds employment law, respects privacy, and protects them from suppression of rights, retaliation and discrimination.</li>

      <h1>The Law is Clear</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <blockquote>
            Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act ("NLRA") in 1935 to protect the rights of employees and employers, to encourage collective bargaining, and to curtail certain private sector labor and management practices, which can harm the general welfare of workers, businesses and the U.S. economy.

        </li>
        <li>
          <blockquote>
            You have the right to act with coworkers to address work-related issues in many ways. Examples include: talking with one or more co-workers about your wages and benefits or other working conditions, circulating a petition asking for better hours, participating in a concerted refusal to work in unsafe conditions, and joining with coworkers to talk directly to your employer, to a government agency, or to the media about problems in your workplace. Your employer cannot discharge, discipline, or threaten you for, or coercively question you about, this "protected concerted" activity.

        </li>
        <li>
          <blockquote>
            The purpose behind pursuing systemic enforcement is to dismantle the pattern, practice or policy that results in or facilitates decisions that are discriminatory. While systemic discrimination can affect significant numbers of employees or applicants, it can also impact small numbers as well.

        <li>
          <blockquote>
            The EEO laws prohibit punishing job applicants or employees for asserting their rights to be free from employment discrimination including harassment.  Asserting these EEO rights is called "protected activity," and it can take many forms.  
            <cite><a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/retaliation">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a></cite>

        </li>
        <li>
          <blockquote>
            California law (called the Fair Employment and Housing Act or FEHA) prohibits discrimination, harassment and retaliation. The law also requires that employers “take reasonable steps to prevent and correct wrongful (harassing, discriminatory, retaliatory) behavior in the workplace (Cal. Govt. Code §12940(k)).
